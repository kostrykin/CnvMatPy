# CnvMatPy

This repository contains the `cnvmats` Python 2.7 module. It provides a few classes, whose instances represent convolution and/or correlation matrices, like `A` and `X` in `Ax = Xa = a*x`, respectively. Besides of multiplication with numpy arrays, the classes of `A` and `X` support transposition using their `tp` method. The convolution is implemented in frequency domain.

The matrix representing objects are instantiated by the `cnvmats.cnvmat` function. This function has a `mode` argument that can be set to either `valid`, `full` or `circ`. The `cnvmats_test.py` file contains tests and examples.
